Achitecture:

1. Relative Stability: Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
   1. Chainlink Pricefeed
   2. Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. Stability Mechaninsm Minting: Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. Ppl can only mint stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto)
   1. wETH
   2. wBTC

1. What are our invariants?
